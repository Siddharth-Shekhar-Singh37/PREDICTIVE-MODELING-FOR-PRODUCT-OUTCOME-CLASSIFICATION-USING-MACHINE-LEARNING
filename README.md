# PREDICTIVE-MODELING-FOR-PRODUCT-OUTCOME-CLASSIFICATION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
The project aimed to classify product outcomes based on a large dataset. The goal was to predict 
potential consequences using Machine Learning techniques. Preprocessed data by cleaning, handling missing values, 
converting variables, and generating summary statistics. Applied Lasso regression for feature selection, identifying key 
predictors of outcomes. Implemented Logistic Regression and KNN models on data subsets, evaluating model performance 
using accuracy, AUC metrics, and K-fold cross-validation. Created visualizations using ggplot2 to uncover trends in product 
types and outcomes. Tools and skills involved include R (tidyverse, glmnet, caTools), Lasso Regression, Logistic Regression, 
KNN, and Data Visualization.
